## A Simple Game

* **Description of the project**

The project created a simple game of dodging collision with oncoming objects. The player wins when he or she manages to dodge one object.

* **How does it work**

The code takes in images (3 sample images attached) and detects their width and length for boundary settings. On coming objects come from random positions.

The player can move up and down, left or right within the limits of the screen window.

The game ends when there is a collision between the player and the oncoming objects or when the player quits the game.
